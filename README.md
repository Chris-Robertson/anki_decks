# My Anki Decks

I use a smart SRS (spaced repetition system) called [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Its free!

I find it incredibly effective. I use it for learning programming (JavaScript, Ruby...), Vim, Regex and various other things.

If you haven't already you should really ckeck it out.

This repoitory is a place for me to store the decks that I create.

You're more than welcome to use them if you find them helpful, just note that it is usually far more effective to create your own cards.
